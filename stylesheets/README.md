# Stylesheets  

These are simple CSS scripts I've written to be used in web extenstions like Stylus. They generally add dark mode, and remove clutter from sites.

* fusion.css : Just makes the content take a bit more of the screen
* oldReddit.css : Brings the posts in to focus, adds darkmode, and removes the signup clutter
* project-gutenburg.css: Changes to a nicer font, and adds darkmode
