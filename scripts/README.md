# Scripts

Here are scripts I have aliased in my [Fish config](https://github.com/Darth-Ness/dotfiles/blob/master/config.fish).

* calc : the worlds simplest calculator, literally one line of shell script
* spell : A spell checker for the terminal. Thanks to [Tyler Cipriani](https://tylercipriani.com/blog/2017/08/14/offline-spelling-with-aspell/) for this script (which I modified slightly).
* note : A simple [incremental](https://thesephist.com/posts/inc/#principles-of-incremental-notes) note taker
